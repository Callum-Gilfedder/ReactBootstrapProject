**Features to add**
* Add login / sign-up.
* User authentication? May require some form of a backend.
* Maybe implement a book API so they can actually search for books.
* Add a page that links to each individual book so you can actually view information about the book as well
as a large image of it.
* Create functioning basket section.
* Add check-out section where you can enter delivery details and card information.
* Payment processing seems like over-kill for this kind of project?
* Make sure the website is fully responsive.
